// COMPARISON OPERATORS
// e.g
var a = 20;
var b = "20";

// == : Which checks for equality between two values/ Operands.
// != : Which checks for un-equality between two values/ operands.
// === : Strictly checks for equality and the type of two values.
// !== : Strictly checks for un-equality and the type of two values.

// console.log(a !== b);
